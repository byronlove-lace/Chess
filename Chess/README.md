# Chess

This project aims to be a simple chess program made in Lua.

## Description 
    1. A table is created containing each piece and its characteristics (x/y coordinates, possible moves, play state, images)
    2. A board is generated as a table containing chess algebra coordinates. The pieces are placed in their respective starting squares.
    3. Board with its pieces are shown through the game engine  and a selector allows the player to choose a piece and see its possible moves.

## Progress 
Currently debugging move implementation

## Background
I've started this project to better familiarize myself with Lua as well as the the Love game engine.
